# Terrain-Project
# Created Terrain and added third person controller
# Painted terrain and added trees
# put into repo, not allowing commits
# found the problem apparently I made a sub-module from a previous repo location and i have to "git add" the new content each time to commit the main repository.
# Recorded the image using unity recorder
